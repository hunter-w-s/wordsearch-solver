# wordsearch-solver
Finds words in a word search file given a raw file with each letter.


This program is mad using JDK 7 on BlueJ.
The intent of this project was so that I could test out what I knew about Java so far as I am just starting.

# Instructions
1. Download the 2 Java files and the .txt file.
2. Run the files in your desired program.
3. For the preset file select a 15 for both the amount of columns and rows.
4. Type a word from the coresponding picture.
5. Read the coords as if X 1 starts on the left by normal convention, and Y 1 is at the very top. The coords tell you where the word starts but not what direction it goes.

If you would like to add your own wordsearch to the program to find a word, clear the wordSearchRaw.txt snf type the letters following this convention

a,b,c,d,e,f,g,

Make sure it ends with a comma.

Thank you
